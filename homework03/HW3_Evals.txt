A total of one point each for the following:

TUI:              : THE FILE WON'T COMPILE SO THERE'S
                     NO WAY TO TELL IF THESE WORK     - 0 point
option 1 roll all : works                             - 0 point
option 2 roll one : works                             - 0 point
option 3 sum      : works                             - 0 point
option 4 save     : works                             - 0 point
option 5 display  : works                             - 0 point
option 6 quit     : works                             - 0 point

Files in Git      : all three present                 - 1 point
Test Harness      : passes all evaluation tests       - 1 point
HighRoll          : passes all evaluation tests       - 2 points

Total 21.86 out of 30 = 72.86% which is a C.

SORRY FOR THE LOW SCORE.  YOUR HighRoll.java DIDN'T COMPILE.  THERE WERE
TWO ERRORS WITH THAT CODE.  FURTHER, LOOKING THROUGH THE CODE, IT IS
APPARENT THAT THE SPECIFICATION WASN'T UNDERSTOOD PROPERLY.  THE IDEA
WAS TO HAVE ONE SET OF DICE FOR THE GAME, NOT A NEW SET EVERY TIME YOU
ROLL, WHICH IS WHAT YOUR CODE DOES.

PERHAPS IF YOU NEED SOME CLARIFICATION OR HAVE QUESTIONS YOU CAN COME
BY MY OFFICE DURING OFFICE HOURS, OR DURING THE "HOPE" SESSION THAT
HAPPENS IN THE KECK LAB ANNEX ON WEDNESDAYS AT NOON.
