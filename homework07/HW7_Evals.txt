Alejandra, I see you wrote code for the extra credit portion, but you
left it commented out.  I gave you 1/2 credit for that.

Also, when I run your code using the test harness, I get IllegalArgumentException
which stops the test harness program from running.  You are not handling the
argument correctly for that.  However, your code looks correct, so I'm giving
you 1/2 credit on those 26 points.

I know that you have worked hard this semester on the programming assignments,
and I admire your persistence in always trying to get things to work.  You are
there in every class session, and work hard to understand the concepts.  I look
forward to having you again in a class.  Next time, let's work together a little
earlier in the semester to make sure you understand things.  If you are shy in
class about asking questions, I can totally understand that, and we can work
together in my office one on one.  Have a great summer break!
